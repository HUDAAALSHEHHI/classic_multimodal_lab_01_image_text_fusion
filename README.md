🧠 Comprehensive Explanation

This experiment demonstrates the foundation of multimodal intelligence through language-based sentiment analysis.
By examining textual captions that describe images, the model interprets emotional tone and meaning, showing how language can mirror perception and emotion.
This approach underlines that understanding multimodal systems begins with mastering linguistic interpretation as the core of cognitive modeling.

✏️ Objective

To analyze the emotional polarity of text captions describing images, proving that language models can infer affective context without visual data.
The experiment highlights the linguistic-emotional link that supports multimodal learning, preparing the ground for advanced systems combining vision, text, and sound.

📘 Results

The model accurately identifies positive, negative, or neutral emotions in image captions.

Confidence scores reflect the system’s certainty for each result.

The output shows how text-based sentiment analysis can serve as a simplified form of multimodal reasoning.
